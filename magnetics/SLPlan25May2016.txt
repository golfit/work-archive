MP 810 - Shoelace antenna, post-move - Day 2

*********
Run Info:
*********
NOTE: this run may be postponed until Thursday pending progress of main cell door repairs.

Reference discharge: 1160520029

Boronization: evening before

ECDC: He ECDC after boronization

Toroidal field: Low-field startup near 3.2 T, flattop will start around 2.7 T to recover 1120814021.  After initial set of 3 T-flattop plasmas, will transition to higher fields later in the day.  Range of flattop fields will be between 2.5 and 4 T.

L-mode target NL04 0.7-1.1x10^20 /m^2

Ip: ~0.75 MA, nominal

Cryopump: yes
ICRF: standby - possible use for brief (100 ms or less), low-power (1 MW or less) pulses to trigger H-mode transition
LH: no
DNB: no

***
Special Gas Puffing:
* For GPI: fill C-Port NINJA plenum with 8 PSI helium
* For CXRS: fill F-Port NINJA with 8 PSI D2
* argon puff for HiREX Sr - will use later in the run
***
Required Diagnostics Set:
GPI
(Mirror Langmuir Probe on A-port scanning probe <- must have this for Part 1 - since ASP is down, we are only doing half-day)
Mirnov coils
PCI
Reflectometer (both fixed and scanning frequency)
Thomson Scattering
***
Desired Diagnostics:
ECE
CXRS
HiREX Sr
TCI/polarimeter if available

Basic Run Plan:
***************
First Reference Discharge: 1160520029

Basic run plan:
1. (5- 8 shots) Boronization recovery 

2. (5 shots) Discharge development: Recover ohmic EDA H-mode.  Make sure outer gap is small.  Try small jog in Ip to help trigger H-mode.  Try to avoid disruption in rampdown; can also shorten length of pulse to make rampdown smoother, shorten time between pulses.

3. (5-9 shots) Examine QCM, Shoelace response
(a) (1 shot) get fiducial shot - measure QCM without Shoelace antenna powered
(b) (i) (2 shots) Perform Shoelace antenna power scan with rising (1 shot) and falling (1 shot) stepped power levels with varying frequency at each step
(ii) (2 shots) Perform Shoelace antenna power scan with ramping power and fixed frequency
(c) (2-4 shots) if haven't gotten good MLP scan yet measuring Shoelace response, adjust scan timing, depth to achieve this

4. Start shot-to-shot scan of Bt and Ip - get through as much of scan as time allows.
(At this point in run, can start trying to puff Ar for HiREX during last 100-200 ms of pulse, assuming Shoelace measurements are complete by then.  Stop if it kills the H-mode.)
a. (2 shots) Increase Bt to 4.0 T, leave Ip at 0.75 MA, repeat Part 2b and c
b. (2 shots) Leave Bt at 4.0 T, increase Ip to 0.85 MA, repeat Part 2b and c
c. (2 shots) Leave Bt at 4.0 T, increase Ip to 0.95 MA, repeat Part 2b and c
d. (2 shots) Increase Bt to 5.0 T, leave Ip at 0.95 MA, repeat Part 2b and c
e. (2 shots) Leave Bt at 5.0 T, decrease Ip to 0.85 MA, repeat Part 2b and c
f. (2 shots) Leave Bt at 5.0 T, decrease Ip to 0.75 MA, repeat Part 2b and c 

5. (should time allow) HiREX Locked Mode Calibration
