#SwapDigitizerNumber.py
#This script swaps the tree references associating coil signal lines with a particular digitizer.  When ACQ_216_1 died, we had to move the coils to ACQ_216_3.  Now that ACQ_216_1 is resurrected, we need to switch the references back.
#
#Usage:
#	python SwapDigitizerNumber.py [s1 [s2]]
#
#	Default: Shot -1 (model tree)
#	range between shots s1 and s2, including s1 and s2.
