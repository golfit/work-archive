"""

Spectral analysis functions for Numerical python written for
compatability with matlab commands with the same names.

  psd - Power spectral density uing Welch's average periodogram
  csd - Cross spectral density uing Welch's average periodogram
  cohere - Coherence (normalized cross spectral density)
  corrcoef - The matrix of correlation coefficients

The functions are designed to work for real and complex valued Numeric
arrays.

One of the major differences between this code and matlab's is that I
use functions for 'detrend' and 'window', and matlab uses vectors.
This can be easily changed, but I think the functional approach is a
bit more elegant.

Please send comments, questions and bugs to:
